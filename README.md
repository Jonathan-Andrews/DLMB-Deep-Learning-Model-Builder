DLMB is a deep learning library that allows you to quickly and easily create machine learning models without requiring much knowledge on machine learning.


Please have a look at this repo's wiki to learn more about this deep learning library.

### Example
To run a quick piece of example code type this into a .py file

``` python
    from dlmb.examples import mnist_example

    mnist_example.run()

```

To learn more check out this repo's wiki.

I will be releasing a Conv, MaxPool and AveragePool layer very soon. There are still just a few issues I have to work through first.
