### First of all, thanks for wanting to help out with this deep learning project.

The only rules I ask you to follow is trying your best to keep the writing style across all modules the same, 
and that any spelling changes be kept to British English spelling.

## Design Decisions:
Some of the design decisions in this code might not be the most pythonic 
(i.e creating a wrapper to check the data types of the arguments being passed to the function).
The reason for these decisions is that I feel it makes the code more readable and prone to less errors.
However, if you really feel that these choices should be changed then you can email me at dlmb.submissions@gmail.com about your ideas.

# Contribution:
Reporting Bugs:
Before opening an issue, please try your best to determine where the problem is coming from and try to fix it. 
If you can fix it then you can start a pull request with your fix, but please also explain the problem your code is fixing.

If you can't fix it yourself then check other issues to see if anyone else has the same problem. If not, then you can open a issue.
when you do please make sure to follow these guide lines to help me fix the problem.

1. Explain clearly the problem you are facing.
2. Provide example code or your actualy code to recreate the problem.
3. Provide the error you are reciving.
4. If asked to, please provide the OS you are using and any other useful information.

# Submiting improvements or adding new files:
I dont really have guidelines for this, except for trying your best to maintain the style choices.
Also please provide good readable comments and documentation for your new code.
